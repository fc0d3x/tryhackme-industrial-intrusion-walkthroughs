# Chess Industry (Boot2Root)

## Description
"Chess Industry (Boot2Root)" is a Capture The Flag (CTF) task designed to simulate a penetration testing scenario where the goal is to gain root access to the machine through various vulnerabilities in the system. This task is based on the **Boot2Root** challenge format, where the player must use their offensive security skills to solve different challenges.

## Task Objectives
- Identify open ports and services running on the machine.
- Exploit vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.
- Gain access to the root flag and solve the puzzle.

## Steps Involved
1. Information gathering (Port scanning, service enumeration).
2. Exploiting vulnerabilities (e.g., remote code execution, privilege escalation).
3. Capture the root flag.

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Netcat
- Metasploit
- Burp Suite (Optional)
- Other tools based on the vulnerability discovered during the task.

## Conclusion
This task is designed to sharpen your skills in penetration testing and help you learn how to exploit common vulnerabilities to gain root access.
